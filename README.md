[**Full Resume**](https://khrapovs.github.io/_static/Stanislav_Khrapov_CV.pdf)

My name is Stanislav Khrapov. Currently, I am a lead data scientist at [Chintai](https://chintai.io/) based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

In the past, I was a Data Scientist at [DB Schenker](https://www.dbschenker.com/global) also based in Frankfurt. There I designed new time series models for forecasting of market freight prices and volumes, company internal financial indicators (EBIT, revenue, receivables, payables, etc.). My responsibilities also included writing end-to-end data ingestion, processing, forecasting, and delivery software mainly in Python and using such tools as web scraping, SQL, pandas, scikit, GitLab, Docker, AWS, Azure, Airflow, etc. I performed research on model comparison in terms of forecasting performance. On top of that I love doing sophisticated visualizations (Seaborn, Dash) for presentation to internal business clients. Most of the time I worked in small teams in agile environment. Finally, I regularly worked as an instructor for the internal AI Training Workshop.

Even before that, as I was working as Assistant Professor of Finance at the [New Economic School in Moscow, Russia](http://www.nes.ru/en/home/) my area of specialization was financial econometrics, option pricing, volatility modeling. During graduate education and work experience that includes both academic and industry positions I wrote research papers individually and in collaboration. Research topics include but not limited to estimation of multivariate volatility and density models, evaluation of option pricing models, term structure of volatility risk premium, volatility forecasting. Accompanying Python code is publicly available at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/khrapovs).

On the personal level I run and swim a lot, bike occasionally (no triathlon, please!). You can join me in this passion on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6131284).
